# Interactive-TODO
This is a todo/note taking application which is built on the MEAN framework.
It will eventually provide various ways of accessing todo's.
It is also a note keeper application.
People can save notes [specially programmers],  which can be then easily searched and reused.
The application will be completely programmer centric, giving ways to add todo's via
command line :)
android
web etc..

Eventually all this will be synced over dropbox!!



Since the basic setup is done,
the next hurdle is to think about the model of todo.

Todo Object:

name -- the basic motto of the todo Ex: calling mother
due date and time -- the deadline Ex: 14 April, Tuesday 5pm 2015
priority --  On a scale of 5, what is the priority of the given todo  Ex: 2
group -- this is to divide the todo's into groups, which should be created before hand Ex: personnal
subtodo -- dividing the todo into a array of subtodo Ex: remind about wedding, remind about bills
