# Interactive-TODO
This is a todo/note taking application which is built on the MEAN framework.
It will eventually provide various ways of accessing todo's.
It is also a note keeper application. 
People can save notes [specially programmers],  which can be then easily searched and reused.
The application will be completely programmer centric, giving ways to add todo's via 
command line :) 
android
web etc..

Eventually all this will be synced over dropbox!!
